# Spark in Action, 2nd edition - chapter 10

Welcome to Spark in Action, chapter 10. This chapter is about ingesting streaming data in Apache Spark. Note that the focus is on structured streaming (not discretized streaming).

Additional examples demo the usage of the various sinks in Spark's structured streaming.

All examples are in Java.

Notes: 
 1. Due to renaming the packages to match more closely Java standards, this project is not in sync with the book's MEAP prior to v10.
